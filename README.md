## 📘 Use an Image as a Link in HTML

This simple HTML project shows how to make an **image clickable** — when you click the image, it opens a link (like a website, another HTML page, or a YouTube channel).

---

### 🧠 What It Does

* Uses the `<a>` tag to create a link.
* Places an `<img>` tag inside it to make the image clickable.
* Opens the link in a new browser tab safely using
  `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

---

### 💻 Example Code

```html
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SRIPARNOROY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/I5M_Q9smMoWwwzYxIi6dGRrfRW9zZ0nFtjFrutsJuK_sYreOnS1tgIjT-nmObZkO6BfHmq2tKIg=s160-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"
       alt="SRIPARNO ROY YouTube Channel Logo"
       width="150" height="150">
</a>
```

Would you like me to make it look a bit **more styled with emojis and badges** (like a polished GitHub project README)?
